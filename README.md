# klipper-t5uic1
Work in progress Klipper/Moonraker frontend for T5UIC1 display. The display and rotary button needs to be attached to RaspberryPI GPIO headers.

There are some early tests I made on the experiments branch, but I recommend checking out https://github.com/odwdinc/DWIN_T5UIC1_LCD
which seems to be a more complete version of what I indended to write here.
